    <p> 
        The (/database) endpoint URI allows clients to retrieve the full dataset from the database. 
        This endpoint does not require any parameters in the URL.
        The endpoint uses GET method to retrieve data from the server. 
        Content-Type is set to (application/json) which ensures that any exchanged between the client and the server is in the JSON format.
        It then queries the database to retrieve all items and responds with the relevant HTTP status codes after cheking for errors. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example input:</strong> GET http://localhost:3000/database </p>
    <p><strong>Example of response output:</strong> [
        {
            "name": "Example 1",
            "year": "2018",
            "genre": "video-game",
            "poster": "https://example1.png",
            "description": "Example 1 description."
        },
        {
            "name": "Example 2",
            "year": "2018",
            "genre": "video-game",
            "poster": "https://example2.png",
            "description": "Example 2 description."
        }

    <section id="create">
        <h2 class="basich2"><u> Create </u></h2>

        <p> Create is part of the CRUD interface that deals with adding data for a new photo item. 
            More specifically, it adds new photo items to the database by making a POST request to the endpoint. 
            The endpoint URI for this operation is (/database) and it acts as the base path for adding new photo items to the database. 
            The content-type here is also set as (application/json), meaning that the response body will be in JSON format. 
            This opertation of course has validation checks as well. 
            If all fields are present and inserting was a success, it returns a 200 OK response. 
            However, if there are any errors, it returns the appropriate error messages as well as its respective HTTP response codes. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example input:</strong> POST http://localhost:3000/database </p>

                <td>400 Bad Request</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if the necessary fields are missing from the JSON body or if the request is not in the JSON content type.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>500 Internal Server Error</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if there is an internal server error during the opertation.</td>

    <section id="retrieve">
        <h2 class="basich2"><u> Retrieve </u></h2>

        <p> 
            Retrieve is apart of the  CRUD interface which deals with listing the data of a specific item. 
            More specifically, it retrieves data of a specific item from the database with the GET method.
            The endpoint URL in this case is (/database/item/:id) and it consists of two parts. 
            First is (/database/item) which represents the base path for accessing items in the database. 
            Second is the route parameter (/:id), which allows dynamic values to be passed in the URL. 
            It represents the unique identifier of the specific item to be retrieved. 
            This operation expects the id parameter to be a valid number and it also returns the data of the specified item in JSON format by setting the content-type in the HTTP response message to (application/json).
            It handles various scenarios such as invalid or non-existing id, internal server errors and a sucessful operation. 
            It returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages according to each scenario.                
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example input:</strong> GET http://localhost:3000/database/item/2 </p>

        <p><strong>Response output:</strong> [
            {
                "name": "Example 1",
                "year": "2018",
                "genre": "video-game",
                "poster": "https://example1.png",
                "description": "Example 1 description."
            }
        ] </p>

        <p><strong>Examples of HTTP response codes for Retrieve:</strong></p>

        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>HTTP status code</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>200 OK</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if the server is returning requested data.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>400 Bad Request</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if the given ID in the URL is not a valid number.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>404 Not Found</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if the given ID does not exist in the database.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>500 Internal Server Error</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if there is an internal server error during the opertation.</td>

    <section id="update">
        <h2 class="basich2"><u> Update </u></h2>

        <p> 
            Update is part of the CRUD interface that deals with the question of "How to change data of a specific item".
            The endpoint URI for Update is (/database/item/:id) with the (/:id) parameter just like for retrieve. 
            However, the uptate operation uses the PUT method to update the data of a specific existing item.
            Like previous operation it expects JSON data in the request body by setting the contenior-type to (application/json).
            Then, it checks if the required fields are present in the JSON body as well as if id parameter is not a number or if it is out of bounds.
            It returns the relevant HTTP response codes depending on the an error response.
            Otherwise, it updates the item in the database and sends a success response.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong> PUT http://localhost:3000/database/item/2 </p>

        <p><strong>Examples of HTTP response codes for Update:</strong></p>

        <table>
            <tr>

                <td>200 OK</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if the update was successful.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>400 Bad Request</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if the ID is not a valid number or is outside the bounds.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>404 Not Found</td>
                <td>This status code is returned if the given ID does not exist in the database.</td>

        <h2 class="basich2"><u> Delete </u></h2>
        <p> 
            Delete is part of the CRUD interface that deals with removing data of a specific item.
            This operation uses the DELETE method to remove the data of a specific item from the database.
            It uses the same endpoint URL as Retrive and Update (/database/item/:id) with same parameter (/:id).
            It first validates the id parameter to ensure it is a number and within the bounds of the database.
            If the id parameter is invalid or out of bounds, it returns an error response.
            Otherwise, it deletes the item from the database and sends a success response.
        </p>
       
        <p><strong>Example input:</strong> DELETE http://localhost:3000/database/item/2 </p>
