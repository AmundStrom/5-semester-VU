          This album is about Kanye being an outsider in the music industry. He was in it but for other people, later ultimately for himself. As a college dropout himself, West uses the cover art and other skits as a criticism on the educational system and peoples expectations of school, while he claims connection pawave the educational way .

          This album focuses on Kanye's transition into celebrity: After the massive popularity of <abbr title="The Collage Dropout">TCD</abbr>, Kanye had a taste of fame but still wasn't used to fame. It was a huge adjustment 
          from where he had been prior. This album is about Kanye starting to understand what fame offers and what it could cost him.
          The album also promots his signature production style known as <strong><em>chipmunk soul</em></strong>, which is using sped-up vocal samples from soul records.

          The message of this album is that he "graduated" to success. Fully transitioned into fame, which allows him to creat whatever he wants and not care how other people react. 
          In comparison to previous albums, which were largely driven by observational commentary on matters dealing with social standers, Graduation is 
          more introspective and addresses personal themes.

          This 2008 release was his first after the passing of his mother, Donda. 
          She played a large role in his life being his only primary care giver. 
          This album was Kanye's way of expreasing his inner termoil, created not only by his
          mother's passing but also the dissolution of his 18-month engagement to Alexis Phifer.
