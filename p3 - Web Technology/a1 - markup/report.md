The overall functionallty of the website worked in both Firefox and Chrome. Links, images and reactive elements were visibale in browesers. Managing the window-size works properlly as well, sizing down or up without problems. We had some diffuculties making the website compatible on mobile phones, since the table would not scale correct and would just move out of the screen. We used the media quires [@media only screen and (max-width: 480pt)] which worked well for all text other text apart from the table. The same problem with the table occured when we tried printing, the table would again break and move out of the print.
